h2(#simplereview). Simple review

Simple review is a web-based tool that makes it easy to comment on changes to text files.

I wrote it as an experiment to see what the most simple tool for code review could look like.

You can find the source code on "github":https://github.com/rickardlindberg/simple-review.
