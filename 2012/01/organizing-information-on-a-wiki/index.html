        <h1>Organizing information on a wiki</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>In this post I explain how I used a wiki to organize ideas about an <a href="/2012/01/application-development-series-intro/">application I&#8217;m developing</a>. I used the wiki on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/orgapp/wiki">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I started by entering all ideas on the start page of the wiki: I listened to recorded ideas and transcribed them, I scanned sketches, and I transfered notes from paper.</p>
<p>Following this was a process of refactoring: I looked for similar ideas and extracted those to new pages with descriptive names. I kept going until the start page only contained an introduction and a bullet list with links to the extracted pages.</p>
<p>As I have had new ideas, I&#8217;ve added them to the appropriate page.</p>
<h2>Refactoring problem</h2>
<p>One reason that I tried using a wiki is that I believe it&#8217;s a good tool for organizing information. I expected it to be easy to move a piece of text from one place to another. (This is important to be able to do because you rarely find the right place the first time.)</p>
<p>But I noticed that extracting pages was quite tedious: first I had to edit the start page, cut the text that I wanted to move, create a new page, give it a title, paste the text from the start page, save the new page, and save the start page.</p>
<h2>Better refactoring support</h2>
<p>A wiki that seems to have a better solution to this problem is Ward Cunningham&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki">smallest federated wiki</a>. A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYrLwlxOKmA">screencast</a> shows how you can drag a paragraph and drop it on another page. And that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>I think that your behaviour will change if you have this refactoring support. Because it&#8217;s easier and faster to organize information, I think you will end up with a better organized wiki in less time.</p>
<p>You can also argue that if refactoring is is easy and fun, you will spend more time doing it than what is actually worth. I think I would still want the feature though.</p>
